## Introduction
The following repository contains solutions to Tensorflow problem sheets written in Python with Jupyter Notebook for the module Emerging Technologies. The module is taught to undergraduate students at GMIT in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics. The lecturer is Ian McLoughlin.

## Prerequisites
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)

## Cloning this Repository
To clone this repository and run the solutions, do the following:

```
In the command line change to a directory:
cd <directory>

Clone the repository:
https://github.com/DillonWard/Tensorflow-Worksheet

Change directory into the cloned folder:
cd <folder name>

*To ensure you're in the right folder, you can run the ls command to display all the files inside the folder. 
Files ending with 'ipynb' are Jupyter Notebook files.*

Run the program:
jupyter notebook
```

## Tensorflow
### What is Tensorflow?
[TensorFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow) is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.

It was originally developed by the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.

TensorFlow is cross-platform. It runs on nearly everything: GPUs and CPUs—including mobile and embedded platforms—and even tensor processing units, which are specialized hardware to do tensor math on.

### What is Tensorflow used for?
Tensorflow has an multiple uses, such as image recognition, human language, and linear models. See the [Tensorflow Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/) for more details.
